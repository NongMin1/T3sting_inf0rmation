But for really good coverage of operating systems and latest browsers versions typically used external services such as:
1.	https://www.browserstack.com/
2.	https://crossbrowsertesting.com/
3.	https://www.browserling.com/
4.	https://saucelabs.com/enterprise#cross-browser-testing

There are a few more services, but those are the most popular.

All services provide similar functionality: 
* Desktop and mobile OS
* Several browsers versions
* Custom screen resolutions
* SSH tunnels
* Tests video and screenshots
* Manual testing

Detailed documentation how to use API is available on each service wiki.
