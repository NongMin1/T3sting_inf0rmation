## Why ISQTB?
ISTQBÂ® is the de facto standard in the certification of software testing competences.

## ISTQB Foundation
### Foundation:
Official documentation might not be enough for preparation, so please check the link to safari books below. Also, you can find attached PDFs with sample questions and leaked real questions.
Preparation time: If you are experienced tester then spent 20h should be enough for preparation and successfully passing the exam. If not then you may have to study a bit longer. The exam itself isn't difficult, at least it wasn't in 2015-2017 :) :)

#### Technical test analyst:
You definitely won't find all necessary information in official documentation, so please the attached link to safari books below.
Preparation time: For me it took more than months of reading after work and on weekends (~100h). The exam isn't easy (some even fail), so take your time and properly prepare for it.
