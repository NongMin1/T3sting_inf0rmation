# Programming Skills

Everyone know there is a long list of programming languages, no need to mention all of them here. Most frequendly used for automated tests development are following:
 * C#
 * Java
 * JavaScript
 * PHP
 * Pyhton
 * Ruby
From IBM projects perspective most demanding are: Java and JavaScript.
Generally, language used for application development used for automated tests as well. Main reasons for such decision - product libraries reusage and easy of help from developers.

Any software tester desiring to automate web UI tests should be familiar with front end technologies HTML/CSS/JavaScript. These will help to understand what’s happening on the page. Even for manual testers programming knowledge helps in identifying possible errors in the application code which further reduces the chances of bugs and application inefficiencies. For back end the technology stack differs and here comes additional programming or scripting languages such as: Java or PHP. Databases are used in a variety of products and services, because of this we can’t avoid SQL. In general the list of programming languages is very big, but for now let’s keep it with those that is widely used in our center. 
 We already identified some programming languages, so let’s start how you can learn them.
HTML and CSS are the simplest from our list. The primary resource for them: w3schools.com:
* https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp
* https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp

For basic information on JavaScript you can use [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp).
But for using testing frameworks such as protractor it's not enough. This framework utilizes asynchronic tests execution, which requires knowledge about promises. An [article](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/promises) to get into.
A few [words](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) about promises from browser side.

A simple Java tutorial can be found [here](http://www.learnjavaonline.org/).

Other resources which might help to improve programming languages knowledge:
* https://www.codingame.com (should be useful for gamers)
* https://www.hackerrank.com/ (has a lot of exercises on all topics)
* https://www.codecademy.com/ 
* https://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript

As you will get some knowledge of programming, start your project with a selenium [framework](http://www.seleniumhq.org/). 

There is a [course](https://yourlearning.w3bmix.ibm.com/#activity/ELC-SSSD_SLWT_A03_IT_ENUS) on Java and Selenium.

It can be easy something like:

1.	Open page
2.	Get some information from it
3.	Put some text on the input field (for example search)
4.	Close browser
